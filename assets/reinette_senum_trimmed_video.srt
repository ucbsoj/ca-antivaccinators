Hello!

2
00:00:07,633 --> 00:00:10,300
It is a great privilege to be here today

3
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:14,699
As probably as much as back in '94
when I was doing a solo crossing of Alaska.

4
00:00:14,733 --> 00:00:19,666
The only ‘where were you?' was those of the Yukon
river as I was skiing down before my eyes

5
00:00:19,666 --> 00:00:22,366
The river began to melt ahead of schedule

6
00:00:22,366 --> 00:00:25,633
And I realize I had two options, and two options only.

7
00:00:25,633 --> 00:00:29,733
I give up, or I find a different way to continue.

8
00:00:29,733 --> 00:00:31,766
Just like we are today.

9
00:00:31,766 --> 00:00:33,000
Are we going to give up?

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,133
[Crowd] No!

11
00:00:34,133 --> 00:00:36,500
Or are we going to find a different way to continue?

12
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:37,100
[Crowd] Yes!

13
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:38,266
You better believe it

14
00:00:38,266 --> 00:00:41,733
So, I had to step down a couple of weeks ago
because I have a ‘step up'

15
00:00:41,733 --> 00:00:44,899
And that’s what we’re asking every single one of you today.

16
00:00:45,966 --> 00:00:48,466
If you are in a place where you are compromised

17
00:00:48,466 --> 00:00:50,566
And you cannot speak the truth

18
00:00:50,566 --> 00:00:53,833
We evaluate where you are

19
00:00:53,833 --> 00:00:57,966
And make a decision to stand on the right side of history.

20
00:00:57,966 --> 00:01:00,400
[Crowd] Yeah!
