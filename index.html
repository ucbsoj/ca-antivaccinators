          <p>A woman threw a menstrual cup full of blood from the California Capitol’s balcony gallery onto the senate floor on the last hours of the last day of the 2019 legislative session, making national news.</p>
          
          <p>“This is for the dead babies,” Rebecca Lee Dalelio was heard to shout as she threw the blood, which splashed onto several senators, temporarily closing the session. The cause? Not women’s reproductive rights. This stunt was a protest against immunizations, specifically in response to legislation Governor Gavin Newsom had signed into law making medical vaccine exemptions harder to procure for school children. In the days preceding the signing, anti-vaccine activists had been protesting outside the Capitol carrying small boxes depicting caskets to represent children’s lives lost due to vaccines. Such protests were a vivid signal to legislators of just how turbulent and outspoken the anti-vaccination movement had grown.</p>

          <p>Dalelio’s stunt followed months of targeted violence against those pushing for the legislation, according to outspoken pro-immunization state senator Dr. Richard Pan, the bills’ author. He was once physically attacked by an activist who live-streamed the assault on Facebook, experiencing firsthand how social media bullying can become real-world threats.</p>

          <p>Despite their intense lobbying effort—designed to maximize media attention—the anti-vaxx the crowd lost this fight. But it turns out they were playing the long game.</p>

          <p>When the coronavirus first arrived in the U.S. in early 2020, California’s anti-vaccine movement lacked any immediate agenda. A mostly virtual operation, the movement comprised geographically dispersed and decentralized fringe groups. But as COVID-19 case counts increased, so too did its talking points and tropes about the specter of mandatory COVID-19 vaccines. Their lingua franca manifested in hashtags and a unique lexicon. And when anti-vaxx private Facebook group posts became more overtly conspiracy-based, social media companies started censoring users and content, triggering more paranoia, disinformation, and platform hopping.</p>

          <p>But it wasn’t until mid-March when Newsom became the first in the U.S. to issue a statewide stay at home order that the movement really got its mojo back. As more pandemic restrictions followed at state and county levels, stakeholders mobilized anti-vaccination members to fight against them. What many Californians accepted as necessary public health protocols; they saw as civil liberty infringements. From the self-determined State of Jefferson in the north to Orange County in the south, Californians rebelled against what they defined as public health overreach. And they used lessons learned from the previous five years of protests to do so.</p>

          <p>Mobilized in 2015 to fight SB 277, which eliminated vaccine exemptions for personal and religious beliefs, the face of this vocal minority has largely been female. Mothers have long been the backbone of the Golden State’s battle against vaccines. Personal belief vaccine exemptions in California, one study found, are most common in areas with a greater percentage of whites and higher incomes. Front and center in the media, groups like Freedom Angels use carefully curated Instagram photos as their battle cries. By the time the pandemic hit its stride in California, these groups were locked and loaded.</p>

          <p>When, while the lovely valley teems with vapour around me, and the meridian sun strikes the upper surface of the impenetrable foliage of my trees, and but a few stray gleams steal into the inner sanctuary, I throw myself down among the tall grass by the trickling stream; and, as I lie close to the earth, a thousand unknown plants are noticed by me: when I hear the buzz of the little world among the stalks, and grow familiar with the countless indescribable forms of the insects and flies, then I feel the presence of the Almighty, who formed us in his own image, and the breath of that universal love which bears and sustains us, as it floats around us in an eternity of bliss; and then, my friend, when darkness overspreads my eyes, and heaven and earth seem to dwell in my soul and absorb its power, like the form of a beloved mistress, then I often think with longing, Oh, would I could describe these conceptions, could impress upon paper all that is living so full and warm within me, that it might be the mirror of my soul, as my soul is the mirror of the infinite God!</p>
          
          <p>As disgruntled groups from nearly every county pushed back against Newsom’s pandemic restrictions and the anti-vaccination movement expanded to encompass other like-minded groups, reinforcements came from everywhere: urban and rural, both alt-right and radical left; women and men from diverse religious, racial and economic backgrounds. Often the only thread they had in common was skepticism of authority, and those in power. Their mantras: act locally, broadcast loudly on social media, and above all distrust the mainstream media.</p>

          <p>The anti-vaccination playbook is tried and true, but the Californian movement’s upward trajectory over the past fifteen months has as much to do with the country’s political and social context as it does with the strength of their mandate. Public health experts concede that state and federal government missteps managing the pandemic and vaccine rollout are contributing to vaccine hesitancy rates, even among those traditionally outside anti-vaxxer ranks.</p>

          <p>Most often cited as the reason for not wanting to get the COVID0-19 vaccine is concern about side effects. Vaccine skeptics used the recent pause of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine to investigate rare blood clots that affected six women out of the 6.8 million who received the vaccine, to escalate the spread misinformation about side effects, which will, in turn, likely increase vaccine hesitancy. Public health experts caution this could impact timelines for meeting herd immunity thresholds.</p>
          
          <p>Who are the influencers driving these efforts and how were they able to join disparate tribes into a coalition and win the hearts and minds of Californians during a period of social distancing and lockdowns? COVID-19 gifted them the opportunity to not just rage against the vaccine, but to fight against the perceived tyranny of a government system in which they no longer have faith. A motivated few are using their rage as a jumping off point to run for statewide office, with support from the others in the burgeoning movement.</p>
            
         <p>A peek behind the curtain into the lives of those who propelled California’s movement forward—their backgrounds, tactics, and how they intersect with each other—is useful in understanding how they’ve been so successful..</p>

          <p>“I’m just trying to protect my fucking town, man,” former two-time mayor of Nevada City Reinette Senum said, about her efforts to save her city. Whether it’s from PG&E cutting down heritage trees to minimize wildfire-related power cuts or from mandatory public health orders, no one doubts Senum’s passion for the town she has called home since she was four. Senum first served as mayor in 2009, when she was voted onto the council by a large majority.</p>

          <p>An outside of the box thinker, then Vice Mayor Senum organized a “Goat Fund Me” crowdsourcing initiative in 2018 to promote prescriptive goat grazing to reduce fire risk on city-owned lands. The campaign was a hit with media and donors and just the kind of unorthodox idea Senum champions.</p>

          <p>But in 2020 Senum and her supporters pivoted their energy to fight against state level COVID-19 pandemic measures. One of California’s long-standing least vaccinated counties, Nevada County had the second lowest immunization rate in the state during the 2018-2019 school year with just 80% of kindergarteners entering school with all required vaccines, compared to the statewide average of nearly 95%. For years, naturopaths—people devoted to alternative medicine and opposed to drugs and surgery—have coexisted with libertarians there to live free from government entanglements. Both groups count vaccine opponents within their ranks.</p>

          <p>I am alone, and feel the charm of existence in this spot, which was created for the bliss of souls like mine. I am so happy, my dear friend, so absorbed in the exquisite sense of mere tranquil existence, that I neglect my talents.</p>

          <p>I should be incapable of drawing a single stroke at the present moment; and yet I feel that I never was a greater artist than now.</p>
