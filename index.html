          <p><span class="firstcharacter">A</span> woman threw a menstrual cup full of blood from the California Capitol&rsquo;s balcony gallery onto the senate floor on the last hours of the last day of the 2019 legislative session, making national news. </p>

          <p>&ldquo;This is for the dead babies,&rdquo; Rebecca Lee Dalelio was heard to shout as she threw the blood, which splashed onto several senators, temporarily closing the session. The cause? Not women&rsquo;s reproductive rights. This stunt was a protest against immunizations, specifically in response to legislation Governor Gavin Newsom had signed into law making medical vaccine exemptions harder to procure for school children. In the days preceding the signing, anti-vaccine activists had been protesting outside the Capitol carrying small boxes depicting caskets to represent children&rsquo;s lives lost due to vaccines. Such protests were a vivid signal to legislators of just how turbulent and outspoken the anti-vaccination movement had grown.</p>

          <p>Dalelio&rsquo;s stunt followed months of targeted violence against those pushing for the legislation, according to outspoken pro-immunization state senator Dr. Richard Pan, the bills&rsquo; author. He was once physically attacked by an activist who live-streamed the assault on Facebook, experiencing firsthand how social media bullying can become real-world threats.</p>
          
          <p>Despite their intense lobbying effort&mdash;designed to maximize media attention&mdash;the anti-vaxx the crowd lost this fight. But it turns out they were playing the long game. </p>

          <p><span class="firstcharacter">W</span>hen the coronavirus first arrived in the United States in early 2020, California&rsquo;s anti-vaccine movement lacked any immediate agenda. A mostly virtual operation, the movement comprised geographically dispersed and decentralized fringe groups. But as COVID-19 case counts increased, so too did its talking points and tropes about the specter of mandatory COVID-19 vaccines. Their lingua franca manifested in hashtags and a unique lexicon. And when anti-vaxx private Facebook group posts became more overtly conspiracy-based, social media companies started censoring users and content, triggering more paranoia, disinformation, and platform hopping.</p>

          <p>But it wasn&rsquo;t until mid-March when Newsom became the <a target="_blank" href="https://news.ballotpedia.org/2021/03/10/one-year-ago-california-became-the-first-state-to-issue-a-stay-at-home-order/">first in the country</a> to issue a statewide stay at home order that the movement really got its mojo back. As more pandemic restrictions followed at state and county levels, stakeholders mobilized anti-vaccination members to fight against them. What many Californians accepted as necessary public health protocols; they saw as civil liberty infringements. From the self-determined State of Jefferson in the north to Orange County in the south, Californians rebelled against what they defined as public health overreach. And they used lessons learned from the previous five years of protests to do so.</p>

          <p>Mobilized in 2015 to fight SB 277, which eliminated vaccine exemptions for personal and religious beliefs, the face of this vocal minority has largely been female. Mothers have long been the backbone of the Golden State&rsquo;s battle against vaccines. Personal belief vaccine exemptions in California, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4695929/">one study found</a>, are most common in areas with a greater percentage of whites and higher incomes. Front and center in the media, groups like Freedom Angels use carefully curated <a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/freedomangels2.0/">Instagram</a> photos as their battle cries. By the time the pandemic hit its stride in California, these groups were locked and loaded.</p>

          <p>As disgruntled groups from nearly every county pushed back against Newsom&rsquo;s pandemic restrictions and the anti-vaccination movement expanded to encompass other like-minded groups, reinforcements came from everywhere: urban and rural, both alt-right and radical left; women <em>and </em>men from diverse religious, racial and economic backgrounds. Often the only thread they had in common was skepticism of authority, and those in power. Their mantras: act locally, broadcast loudly on social media, and above all distrust the mainstream media.</p>

          <p>The anti-vaccination playbook is tried and true, but the Californian movement&rsquo;s upward trajectory over the past fifteen months has as much to do with the country&rsquo;s political and social context as it does with the strength of their mandate. Public health experts concede that state and federal government missteps managing the pandemic and vaccine rollout are contributing to vaccine hesitancy rates, even among those traditionally outside anti-vaxxer ranks. </p>

          <p>A survey published last month by the&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.ppic.org/publication/ppic-statewide-survey-californians-and-their-government-march-2021/">Public Policy Institute of California</a> found one in five Californians said they would either probably not or definitely not get the COVID-19 vaccine. The U.S. Census Bureau released a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2021/04/how-do-covid-19-vaccination-and-vaccine-hesitancy-rates-vary-over-time.html">vaccination tracker</a> tool this month populated by results from&nbsp; periodic household surveys it has conducted since the start of the pandemic. Their data places California&rsquo;s vaccine hesitancy rate at the end of March for those aged 18 and over at about 10%, which is below the national 15.6% average. Among Republican men, the national rate is closer to 49%, according to an <a target="_blank" href="https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2021/03/12/976172586/little-difference-in-vaccine-hesitancy-among-white-and-black-americans-poll-find">NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist</a> poll published last month. New York Times <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/04/17/us/vaccine-hesitancy-politics.html">data analysis</a> bears this out, showing lower vaccine rates and willingness to vaccinate in counties that voted for Trump.</p>

          <p>Most often <a target="_blank" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2021/01/16/capitol-riot-family-fbi/">cited</a> as the reason for not wanting to get the COVID-19 vaccine is concern about side effects. Vaccine skeptics used the recent pause of the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine to investigate rare blood clots that affected six women out of the 6.8 million who received the vaccine, to escalate the spread misinformation about side effects, which will, in turn, likely increase vaccine hesitancy. Public health experts caution this could impact timelines for meeting herd immunity thresholds. </p>

          <p>Who are the influencers driving these efforts and how were they able to join disparate tribes into a coalition and win the hearts and minds of Californians during a period of social distancing and lockdowns? COVID-19 gifted them the opportunity to not just rage against the vaccine, but to fight against the perceived tyranny of a government system in which they no longer have faith. A motivated few are using their rage as a jumping off point to run for statewide office, with support from the others in the burgeoning movement.</p>

          <p>A peek behind the curtain into the lives of those who propelled California&rsquo;s movement forward&mdash;their backgrounds, tactics, and how they intersect with each other&mdash;is useful in understanding how they&rsquo;ve been so successful.</p>

          <p><span class="firstcharacter">I</span>&rsquo;m just trying to protect my fucking town, man,&rdquo; former two-time mayor of Nevada City Reinette Senum said, about her efforts to save her city. Whether it&rsquo;s from PG&amp;E cutting down heritage trees to minimize wildfire-related power cuts or from mandatory public health orders, no one doubts Senum&rsquo;s passion for the town she has called home since she was four. Senum first served as mayor in 2009, when she was voted onto the council by a large majority. </p>

          <p>An outside of the box thinker, then Vice Mayor Senum organized a &ldquo;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/GoatFundMeNevadaCity">Goat Fund Me</a>&rdquo; crowdsourcing initiative in 2018 to promote prescriptive goat grazing to reduce fire risk on city-owned lands. The campaign was a hit with media and donors and just the kind of unorthodox idea Senum champions. </p>

          <p>But in 2020 Senum and her supporters pivoted their energy to fight against state level COVID-19 pandemic measures. One of California&rsquo;s long-standing least vaccinated counties, Nevada County had the second lowest immunization rate in the state during the <a target="_blank" href="https://eziz.org/assets/docs/shotsforschool/2018-19CAKindergartenSummaryReport.pdf">2018-2019</a> school year with just 80% of kindergarteners entering school with all required vaccines, compared to the statewide average of nearly 95%. For years, naturopaths&mdash;people devoted to alternative medicine and opposed to drugs and surgery&mdash;have coexisted with libertarians there to live free from government entanglements. Both groups count vaccine opponents within their ranks. </p>

          <p>Nevada City, with just over 3000 residents, is a microcosm of the county. While the majority of town residents were on board with Newsom&rsquo;s coronavirus orders, vocal factions objected to the state dictating county-level policies. As with many other counties, grassroots efforts were made to blast board of supervisor and city council meetings with public comments against stay at home and mask mandates. With coronavirus rates varying wildly across California&mdash;even across this county&mdash;some criticized a one-size fits all pandemic response. Especially initially, when the county&rsquo;s COVID-19 case and death rates were low and primarily in the eastern part of the county.</p>
          <p><strong></strong></p>
          <p>But when Senum <a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/reinettesenum/posts/10220583511312175">posted a video</a> on her Facebook page from Orange County anti-mask advocate Peggy Hall last June, sentiment in the town changed. &ldquo;As you go about your day, KNOW there is NO LAW that orders you to wear a mask. Our governor does not have that unilateral authority to make such orders. While I know the HEADLINES over the last couple days have stated something entirely different, that is because journalism is dead,&rdquo; she wrote. Nevada City&rsquo;s council received hundreds of public comments during meetings calling for Senum&rsquo;s resignation.</p>

          <p>Even her detractors will admit Senum is driven, civic-minded and wants what&rsquo;s best for Nevada City. A jack of all trades, she says she&rsquo;ll do whatever it takes to pay the bills so she can do her volunteer work. In addition to her city government positions, she&rsquo;s worked as a nanny, commercial fisher, dog musher, house painter and nonprofit director. Senum also holds the record for being the first woman to solo ski across Alaska, which she did in 1994 pulling a 150lbs sled and filming the journey for National Geographic Explorer. Working to keep Nevada City sustainable is intrinsic to Senum&rsquo;s beliefs. And for much of her life, that has meant working within the Democratic party and in progressive circles.</p>

          <p>But over the past four years the culture changed in Nevada County and Senum now finds herself working with people from across the political and economic spectrum, and more often than not, Republicans. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sitting down with total Trump lovers. They&rsquo;re totally into QAnon, right.&rdquo; And what we all have in common, she says, is our anti-vaxx stance and our desire to protect children. Her views and current company have cost her lifelong friends, but Senum says the reason she&rsquo;s crossed over is that conservatives are the only ones questioning the narrative. </p>

          <p>Every Monday evening, Senum says, a huge array of people from across political and religious spectrums, sit around her table. It&rsquo;s the way it should be, it&rsquo;s a beautiful scene. One of the groups with whom Senum meets regularly are the Freedom Angels, a group founded by three women in 2019 to fight against Pan&rsquo;s SB-276 immunization legislation.</p>

          <p>When the Freedom Angels failed both to defeat and repeal SB-276, their raison d&rsquo;&ecirc;tre dimmed. Fast forward a few months and they were back in business protesting lockdown and mask mandates in county after county. As the pandemic wore on, and Californians grew weary of quarantines, the Freedom Angels amped up their efforts by holding protests at county public health officer homes and board of supervisor meetings. Their live Instagram pleas for help resulted in thousands of anti-vaxxers calling in to county, city and school board meetings to protest against pandemic ordinances.</p>

          <p>The first group to receive permission during the pandemic to hold a rally at the state Capitol, the Freedom Angels were well-positioned for maximum media coverage last May and a dramatic photo of them being detained by the California Highway Patrol ran in the New York Times. As the pandemic continued, their efforts became more extreme, and they became more adept at networking to bring like-minded individuals to join them. The far-right neo-fascist Proud Boys proudly stood on the Freedom Angels stage offering their security services at another rally.</p>

          <p>Social media continues to be the tried-and-true way Senum and her fellow activists shared information and personable videos and memes were the preferred formats. One way Senum stepped up by stepping down was to launch an anti-vaxx video podcast called &ldquo;Western Women Save the World,&rdquo; a nod to the Dalai Lama&rsquo;s comments at a 2009 peace summit he attended with female Nobel peace laureates. Senum&rsquo;s first guest was Hall, often called &ldquo;COVID Karen&rdquo; by her detractors. Senum went on to host a number of other anti-vaxx and COVID-19 denier heavy hitters including Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine Sherri Tenpenny, who regularly makes the anti-vaccination rounds on social and alternative media outlets. </p>

          <p>Tenpenny was singled out in a report published last month as one of the famed &lsquo;disinformation dozen,&rsquo; a group of individuals responsible for two-thirds of the anti-vaccine propaganda on social media. The Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH) and Anti-Vax Watch analyzed more than 800,000 examples of anti-vaccine content and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.counterhate.com/disinformationdozen">found</a> social media platforms failed to act on 95% of the COVID-19 and vaccine misinformation reported to them. They estimated that if Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube enforced their own terms of service associated with these dozen individuals, it could impact the vaccine hesitancy of up to 18 million American adults.</p>

          <p>To circumvent censorship by social media companies, Senum has jumped platforms multiple times&mdash; Brand New Tube, Bitchute and Telegram are popular alternatives&mdash;as her content was pulled, a common practice among those trading in anti-vaccine conspiracies. Facebook, in particular, began in earnest late last year censoring content and ads that contained COVID-19 vaccine misinformation. Previously they only removed false COVID-19 information they determined could result in &ldquo;imminent&nbsp; physical harm&rdquo; and advertisements promoting anti-vaxx conspiracy theories. </p>

          <p>A politician at heart, Senum knows how to work a crowd. In addition to her podcast, she&rsquo;s a fixture at medical freedom protests and rallies and recently announced her intention to run for governor against Newsom. At last year&rsquo;s &lsquo;United We Stand&rsquo; rally in Sacramento Senum said &ldquo;If I were governor, you know what I would do? I would make sure that this &lsquo;so called&rsquo; pandemic was not about politics, but about health.&rdquo; Senum shared the stage that day with many others, including several who would, six months later, take part in the Capitol insurrection riots in D.C.</p>

          <p>By September Hall had become infamous around Southern California for her anti-mask rant videos. While not one of the disinformation dozen, video blogs of her maskless forays into San Clemente supermarkets often went viral and Hall parlayed that notoriety into a full-time job. She launched &lsquo;The Healthy American&rsquo; website just as the pandemic began and set out &ldquo;breathing life back into liberty&rdquo; for Californians hellbent on avoiding COVID-19 restrictions. And she made bank, while doing it, listing many ways to donate across her website.</p>

          <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very passionate about health freedom and I&rsquo;m very opposed to medical terrorism,&rdquo; Hall said. After the CDC flip-flopped on the efficacy of mask use and Newsom made masks mandatory across the state in June, Hall went into overdrive to explain why that, and other orders, were illegal and need not be followed. As emergency public health orders continued for months, so too did Hall&rsquo;s popularity and zealousness. </p>

          <p>As a non-essential contract employee of a Mission Viejo community college, Hall lost her teaching job shortly after the pandemic shut down much of California. Hall&rsquo;s new job became posting daily <a target="_blank" href="https://www.bitchute.com/hashtag/thehealthyamerican/">civics lesson videos</a> to help others understand how government works and why she believed state public health guidance was unconstitutional. As with many in California&rsquo;s medical freedom movement, Hall&rsquo;s message from Orange County to Newsom was, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re thriving without your intervention and people want to make their own decisions.&rdquo; </p>

          <p>Like Senum, Hall&rsquo;s has a colorful career history: She&rsquo;s worked as an adult educator, animal rights activist, life coach, surfing yoga instructor and Peace Corps Volunteer. But it wasn&rsquo;t until she became Orange County&rsquo;s anti-mask mascot that she found her real calling. Even though &ldquo;No Governor can make a law!&rdquo; claims were debunked by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/jun/24/facebook-posts/yes-gov-newsom-has-authority-make-masks-mandatory-/">Politifact</a>, more than 300,000 viewers tuned in to hear her explain them. Thousands more tune in each day for Hall&rsquo;s peppy tips on keeping your head above the stormy seas of life, she says, so that you can see brighter days ahead. </p>

          <p>Raised by a mother who was a nurse, Hall was not vaccinated and taught to be skeptical of medicine and stay away from hospitals and doctors. Hall took that message to heart, hearing it from someone on the front lines of nursing for 40 years.</p>

          <p>Hall says she&rsquo;s received thousands of inquiries from people being told by their employers they can&rsquo;t come to work unless they&rsquo;ve had a COVID-19 test. And then, she says, they&rsquo;ll replace &lsquo;test&rsquo; with &lsquo;vaccine.&rsquo; Hall calls the COVID-19 vaccine an injection, medical experiment or type of gene therapy. It&rsquo;s not a vaccine, she says, since it hasn&rsquo;t been approved by the FDA. Anti-vaccine activists make this distinction, noting that the COVID-19 vaccine has been authorized, not approved, under the FDA&rsquo;s <a target="_blank" href="https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/mcm-legal-regulatory-and-policy-framework/emergency-use-authorization">Emergency Use Authorization</a>.</p>

          <p>Mocked by many (her high-energy videos have been <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/DontBeAPeggy1/status/1363663620551315461">parodied</a> across social media); Hall has cracked the code on how to make money by billing herself as an authority on California&rsquo;s legal codes. Despite her frequent misinterpretation of laws and statutes, which has led Facebook and YouTube to censor her for spreading COVID-19 misinformation, Hall is thriving. After being censored from mainstream platforms, Hall created her own subscription-based <a target="_blank" href="https://www.peggyhall.tv/">TV channel</a> to host her content, for $4.99 a month, and also sells mask exemption documents that carry no legal weight, from her website.</p>

          <p>Available for free on Hall&rsquo;s site are templates for communicating with official entities like CALTRANS. That template explains that the agency&rsquo;s &lsquo;No Mask, No Service&rsquo; signs are violations of civil rights and the Americans with Disabilities Act. Would CALTRANS display signs, Hall writes, that say &lsquo;No Blacks allowed on Bus&rsquo; or &lsquo;Muslims are prohibited from service&rsquo;? </p>

          <p>When called out on misinterpreting laws or policy, Hall quickly pivots, citing other laws. When caught on camera lying to a shopkeeper about being a public health official, she flashes her thousand-watt smile and blames the government for not following laws and for letting corporations police behavior. Her biggest fight, she says, is against &ldquo;The United States of Costco.&rdquo;</p>

          <p>Hall has appeared on countless anti-vaxx shows and panels to help spread her message and gain more followers, but is adamant she is an advocate, educator and activist&mdash;but not a protester. She admits she&rsquo;s &ldquo;done a couple of things loosely&rdquo; with the more radical Freedom Angels, but distances herself from the frontlines of the medical tyranny movement. When her name was tied to a #ShopMaskFree <a target="_blank" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-01-30/dodger-stadiums-covid-19-vaccination-site-shutdown-after-dozens-of-protesters-gather-at-entrance">LA Dodgers Stadium protest</a> this past January that temporarily shut down a COVID-19 vaccination site, Hall laid low for a few weeks. </p>

          <p>Whether she admits it or not, Hall is a cog in the wheel of the anti-vaccine movement and shares responsibility in spreading public health mis- and disinformation. She may not be, as she describes it, &ldquo;on the front lawns of the lawmakers and that kind of thing,&rdquo; her polished performance online still wields power and has consequences.</p>

          <p><span class="firstcharacter">A</span>lison Hayden openly admits she&rsquo;s a QAnon follower, but says it&rsquo;s just one of many sources in her arsenal. Hayden was the GOP candidate who faced off against Democratic incumbent Eric Swalwell last November for California&rsquo;s 15<sup>th</sup> congressional district seat. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just looking for information. Perspective. That&rsquo;s what America is all about.&rdquo; </p>

          <p>One of five Californian QAnon-affiliated candidates who ran in 2020, Hayden&rsquo;s campaign platform aligned with many of QAnon&rsquo;s conspiracy pillars, including distrust and disdain for mainstream media. &ldquo;Those in power are using the media as a weapon,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;How do you get information out? People have to go to other sources to get information. Belief is a fluid process. You don&rsquo;t know what you don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>

          <p>One thing Hayden is sure about is that vaccines can&rsquo;t be trusted. Asked if she planned to get the COVID-19 vaccine, Hayden said, &ldquo;No. I&rsquo;m not sick, why would I take it?&rdquo; Well-versed in anti-vaccination talking points, Hayden describes the vaccine as a depopulation plan engineered by Bill Gates, Anthony Fauci and George Soros. It is, she says, part of a biological warfare campaign being waged against Americans.</p>

          <p>&ldquo;What is a vaccine, but the hair of the dog that bit you?&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want the hair of the dog.&rdquo; Hayden is skeptical that the coronavirus pandemic even exists, which is a common belief in the anti-vaxx movement. &ldquo;Worldwide sanitation is far better than it&rsquo;s ever been. Why are we having pandemics, then?&rdquo; </p>

          <p>Like many straddling QAnon and anti-vaccine camps, Hayden is also opposed to mask mandates, quarantines for healthy people, and statewide lockdowns. It&rsquo;s all part of a &ldquo;multi-pronged effort to weaken Americans,&rdquo; she said. She&rsquo;s not alone in this thinking.</p>

          <p>But Hayden&rsquo;s political platform goes beyond QAnon and her path to politics is definitely the road less traveled. Born in Sacramento to parents whose forefathers, she says, came to America in the 1700s, Hayden was not pleased with the direction the country was going. She knew challenging Swalwell was a shot in the dark&mdash;she received just 30 percent of the vote in the general election&mdash;but she wanted to channel her idol John F. Kennedy&rsquo;s famous words and find an outlet for her civic duty. </p>

          <p>Raised in Taipei, Hayden was an Air Force brat and then a third culture expat kid. She attended boarding school in Taiwan when her father transitioned from the military to a multinational corporation. It was these expat experiences that shaped her life&rsquo;s trajectory. Degrees from UC Berkeley and London School of Economics were followed by banking and finance jobs and a stint as a Peace Corps volunteer doing economic advising in Bulgaria.</p>

          <p>It wasn&rsquo;t until years later, after working for fifteen years as a special education teacher in the Bay Area that Hayden considered entering politics. A call out of the blue from Ben Carson&rsquo;s presidential campaign staff asking her to be his Alameda County area coordinator was how it started. When Carson dropped out of the race, Hayden transferred her loyalty to Trump. Not initially a Trump fan, Hayden loved that he took the reins<em>. &ldquo;</em>Trump is about economics and not wars. Under Obama we had eight undercover wars and we had none under Trump&rsquo;s leadership. He was also all about breaking the stronghold of the Chinese, she said.&rdquo; Now a strident Trumper, Hayden says &ldquo;Trump&rsquo;s brilliance was to show, on many fronts, what a scam everything is.&rdquo; </p>

          <p>Had she won, Hayden would have been the first ever woman and the first Republican in two decades to hold that Bay Area congressional seat. Part of a growing demographic of like-minded activists who believe they&rsquo;re part of the awakening of America movement, Hayden&rsquo;s views mirror those of other Californian alt-right patriots and medical freedom fighters who have coalesced into a one cohesive and disgruntled faction. </p>

          <p>Hayden, like others in this newly formed movement, supported Trump&rsquo;s reelection campaign. Frustrated both by ongoing pandemic restrictions and election outcomes, she joined #StopTheSteal rallies and protests across California. Hayden believed, along with thousands of others in the state, that neither California nor national election results were valid, and that there is no way to know who actually won in many races, including her own. </p>

          <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m holding out that Trump&rsquo;s not done,&rdquo; she said, a month after Trump officially conceded to Biden. By then Hayden had joined the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.eip-ca.com/">Election Integrity Project California</a>, a nonprofit organization&mdash;active in many states&mdash;challenging what they claim to be unconstitutional election processes. Hayden was holding out hope, well into February, that Sidney Powell&rsquo;s lawsuits before the Supreme Court and Republican efforts challenging the 2020 election results would be successful.</p>

          <p>Back in California, Hayden joined many other disillusioned anti-vaxxers in the #RecallNewsom effort. Actively soliciting recall signatures, Hayden admitted that unless the entire election system was changed, recall efforts were futile. Her election experience left her disillusioned with California&rsquo;s political system. She believes the GOP party in her district was co-opted by both the Democratic party and Chinese Communist Party. The only way to right the wrongs from the last election, she says, would be to hold a re-vote under the guidance of the military.</p>

Emboldened by the Trump Administration&rsquo;s tacit endorsement of their beliefs and weary from a year unlike any other, many traveled to D.C. to take part in the January 6 protests. Some breached the U.S. Capitol, others made public threats, and several were questioned by the FBI when they returned to home.</p>

          <p>Freedom Angel founder Denise Aguilar told supporters in front of the Supreme Court on January 6, &ldquo;We are here to recruit you. We are done with bills. We are done with newsletters. We&rsquo;re done with emails. We are boots on the ground, and it&rsquo;s our responsibility to take our government back.&rdquo; Two weeks later Aguilar hosted a Zoom session to recruit squad leaders for each California county for her mom militia group called <a target="_blank" href="https://mamalitia.org/">Mamalitia</a>. Designed to promote survivalism, Mamalitia members train monthly on arms, agriculture, first aid and whatever else is needed. Aguilar said they are legally authorized by the state&rsquo;s <a target="_blank" href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=MVC&amp;sectionNum=120.#:~:text=120.,2020%2C%20Ch.">Military and Veterans code 120</a>, which lays out allowable active and unorganized militia (Mamalitia is the latter). &ldquo;We are building and creating the world we want to live in, now that we&rsquo;ve seen the agenda being played out,&rdquo; she said. Recent press <a href="https://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article251000429.html" target="_blank">Mamalitia media coverage</a> led the group to cancel all upcoming public community events, but notes in a press release they continue to solicit new members.</p>

          <p>Hayden failed to get elected to congress on her platform of local governance, the primacy of individual rights, and fighting against state and federal government apparatuses. But five weeks after the storming of the U.S. Capitol, her message about the awakening was more direct. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s either live free or die. We&rsquo;re being manipulated. We are at war. They declared it with their biowarfare, and the vaccine regime has to be stopped,&rdquo; she said. </p>

          <p>Eight days after the insurrection, a group of #RecallNewsom activists threatened Californian lawmakers during a budget hearing in Sacramento. One said, &ldquo;Mandated medicine is a disgrace, now and forever&rdquo; while another said, &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t buy guns for nothing.&rdquo; An alarmed Senator Pan said, &ldquo;I think the thing that&rsquo;s most concerning is that they&rsquo;re escalating.&rdquo;</p>

          <p>Senum hosted Hall and earlier this month on her <a target="_blank" href="https://www.bitchute.com/video/nf1YFHEv5Z1g">BitChute channel</a> to talk about COVID-19 vaccines and Orange County&rsquo;s planned vaccine passports. Hall refused to call it a vaccine and said without FDA approval, it&rsquo;s not a vaccine but just a &ldquo;poison needle medical experiment.&rdquo; Anticipating being locked out of society by de facto vaccine passports, Hall advocated, as have many others in the movement, for Californians to create new self-reliant societies of 50-100 people. At an Orange County Board of Supervisors meeting a few weeks later, protesters showed up to comment wearing yellow stars and equating vaccine passports with Holocaust tattoos.</p>
          
          <p>The March 20 &lsquo;Freedom Rally&rsquo; gathering at Huntington Beach was one of many synchronized global events staged in protest of what many see as public health overreach wrought by the pandemic. Telegram and Instagram posts promised #WeWillAllBeThere, and turnout at Huntington Beach delivered on that account. Similar rallies occurred across California, including one in Grass Valley where Senum spoke passionately out of the back of a pickup truck.</p>

          <p>In Orange County, suburbanites in ballroom gowns stood shoulder-to-shoulder with alt-right renegades, college radicals and fringe religious groups. The multicultural and ethnically diverse assemblage banded together over their mutual discontent. Flamboyant Trump 2024 and #RecallNewsom contingents in full regalia overshadowed some anti-vaccination purists. But they all shared the singular goal of a prompt return to pre-pandemic life. </p>

          <p>The rally coincided with Newsomâ€™s efforts to reopen the majority of Californiaâ€™s 58 counties. Despite having the highest COVID-19 death and case numbers of any state, California continues to experience declining case rates as it encourages COVID-19 vaccinations. For those at these rallies, though, Newsomâ€™s efforts might be too little, too late. What happens in California will be shaped by upcoming political skirmishes and continued efforts of those using misinformation to push back against science and public health consensus. </p>
